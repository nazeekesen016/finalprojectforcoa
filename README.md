# finalprojectforcoa

Simple visual program created on C# that connects to the local SQL database to get some recipes by name and ingredients.

DISCLAMER: This program was made by me with the sole purpose of passing a subject at the university, so the program is neither well structured, nor bug proof, nor did I try to follow any coding standarts at that time, so keep that in mind when viewing this code.
